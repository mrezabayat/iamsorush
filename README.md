# What is this repo?

This is my blog [IamSorush.com](https://iamsorush.com)  which is a static website complied using Hugo on Netlify. 
Netlify provides CDN and Continuous deployment. So after pushing each commit to this repo
Netlify compiles it automatically and re-publish the website on its CDN.

The website is designed by myself to keep it as light and fast as possible. Each page is around 100 KB while 
on the internet average pages are around 4MB (reference google). To reach this aim, I write CSS and Javascript
by myself rather than using libraries like JQuery and Bootstrap. There are some libraries that I cannot write or 
don't have time to write like showing math equations properly. In most pages, I try to avoid them as much as aesthetically not jeopardising the website.
