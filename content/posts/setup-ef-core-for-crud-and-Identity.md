## Goal 

In this post, step by step I create a web app using Entity Framework core and razor pages. The app is a library that admin can CRUD books info on a database and authenticated users can browse the records.

<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/choose_razor_pages.webp" class="article-image"  />
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/choose_name.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}

You will have a project like below

## Create EF Models

Models can contain any logic, but here models refer to tables in the database. Create the folder and files like below

{{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/model_folder.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}


When we defining a model (or table here), we not only consider columns of the table but also it's a relationship with other models (or tables). In this example, I only focus on the one-to-many relationship. Each book *has a* publisher, and  each publisher *has many* books. 

## Publisher Model

In `Publisher.cs` I have

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace EfCoreRazorCrud.Models
{
    public class Publisher
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public ICollection<Book> Books { get; set; }
    }
}
```

`Id` must be named Id so EF set it as the **primary key** of `Publisher` table. `Name` is an example of a table column, other columns can be added by defining new properties like address and website. The last line will not create a column but is an EF core convention to create a one-to-many relationship that each publisher has many books. The properties which are not primitive type like `Book` are called **navigation properties**. 

## Book Model

We can mention the relationship in the Book class, see `Book.cs`:

```cpp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace EfCoreRazorCrud.Models
{
    public class Book
    {
		public int Id { get; set; }
		public string Title { get; set; }

		public int PublisherId { get; set; }
		public Publisher Publisher { get; set; }

		[NotMapped]
		public string FilePath
		{
			get { return Path.Combine("..","pdf",Title + ".pdf"); }
		}

	}
}
```

In `Book` class, `Id` is the default primary key, `Title` is an arbitrary column in the Book table, more  can be added like author, year, and edition. `PublisherId` and `Publisher` are EF core conventions to have the relationship that each book has a publisher. Here `Publisher` is the navigation property. Note that the foreign class id and name must follow the convention *class name + Id* and *class name*.   

If a property needs to be ignored by EF core, like `File Path`, annotate it with `[NotMapped]`. 


To have a one-to-many relationship, mentioning the relationship in the `Book` class was not necessary. Personally, I prefer to have them in the `Book` class, so when a Book record is pulled from the database, automatically its corresponding publisher is found too. 

## AppUser Model

`IdentityUser` is the default class that .Net core uses for user authentication. It contains username, email, password and related information. To add custom properties to the class we have to derive another class, `AppUser` here. `AppUser.cs` file contains

```cpp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace EfCoreRazorCrud.Models
{
    public class AppUser : IdentityUser
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}
```

I added only property `Name` but any arbitrary column table can be added like `StartMembership`, `EndMembership`, or a one-to-many relationship with `Book` class to denote the books a user borrowed. 

## AppUser in Startup

We have to modify `ConfigureServices` in `Startup.cs` so it uses the new `AppUser` class instead of the default `IdentityUser`:

```cpp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // some codes here ...
    services.AddDefaultIdentity<Models.AppUser>(
        options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
        .AddRoles<IdentityRole>()
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
    // rest of the code ...
}
```

Make sure `.AddRoles<IdentityRole>()` is there as well which is necessary to have roles like admin, user, and so on.
There are other instances of `IdentityUser` in other files, simply find all them by `Ctrl+f` replace them with `Models.AppUser`. Otherwise you get some errors.

I found two of them in `_LoginPartials.cshtml`:

```c#
@inject SignInManager<Models.AppUser> SignInManager
@inject UserManager<Models.AppUser> UserManager
```

## ApplicationDbContext

`ApplicationDbContext.cs` is changed to have the name of tables

```c#
    public class ApplicationDbContext 
                : IdentityDbContext<AppUser> //Note AppUser
    {
        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options)
            : base(options)
        {
        }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

            SeedData(modelBuilder);
            AddAdmin(modelBuilder);
        }

        public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Publisher> Publishers { get; set; }
	
	// rest of the code ...
    }
}
```
## Seed data

`SeedData` is created to initialize the database with some test records:

```c#
private void SeedData(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Publisher>().HasData(
        new Publisher() { Name = "Little, Brown and Company", Id = -1 },
        new Publisher() { Name = "Scholastic", Id = -2 }
        );
    modelBuilder.Entity<Book>().HasData(
        new Book() { Id = -1, Title = "Harry Potter And The Cursed Child", PublisherId = -1 },
        new Book() { Id = -2, Title = "The Hunger Games", PublisherId = -2 }
        );


    modelBuilder.Entity<AppUser>().HasData(

        new AppUser()
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            UserName = "a@test.com",
            NormalizedUserName = "a@test.com".ToUpper(),
            Email = "a@test.com",
            NormalizedEmail = "a@test.com".ToUpper(),
            EmailConfirmed = true,
            SecurityStamp = string.Empty,
            PasswordHash = HashPassword(null, "pass")
        });
}
        
```
and I added the admin here as well

```c#
private void AddAdmin(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    string adminId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    string roleId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();


    modelBuilder.Entity<IdentityRole>()
    .HasData(new IdentityRole { 
        Id = roleId, 
        Name = "Admin", 
        NormalizedName = "Admin".ToUpper() });

    modelBuilder.Entity<AppUser>().HasData(
        new AppUser()
        {
            Id = adminId,
            Name = "admin",
            UserName = "admin@test.com",
            NormalizedUserName = "admin@test.com".ToUpper(),
            Email = "admin@test.com",
            NormalizedEmail = "admin@test.com".ToUpper(),
            EmailConfirmed = true,
            SecurityStamp = string.Empty,
            PasswordHash = HashPassword(null, "pass")

        });

    modelBuilder
    .Entity<IdentityUserRole<string>>()
    .HasData(new IdentityUserRole<string>
    {
        RoleId = roleId,
        UserId = adminId
    });
}
```

`IdentityUser` saves the hash of a password, so I created the below function for that purpose:

```c#
string HashPassword(AppUser user, string password)
{
    var hasher = new PasswordHasher<AppUser>();
    return hasher.HashPassword(user, password);
}
```

## Seed data in Startup

we visit `Startup.cs` again and add the below function apply seed data on startup

```c#
private static void UpdateDatabase(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    using (var serviceScope = app.ApplicationServices
        .GetRequiredService<IServiceScopeFactory>()
        .CreateScope())
    {
        using (var context = serviceScope.ServiceProvider.GetService<ApplicationDbContext>())
        {
            context.Database.Migrate();
        }
    }
}
```

and call it as below

```c#
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    UpdateDatabase(app); // should be first line
    // rest of code
}
```

## Create authorized folders

Now we create two folders in pages: *Admin* and *Users*

{{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/admin_user_folder.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}

Any page in folder *Admin* is only visible by admin, and any page in *Users* folder is visible by authenticated users.
Let's define these rules in `Startup.cs`, the final `ConfigureServices` shown below

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(
            Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
    services.AddDefaultIdentity<Models.AppUser>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
        .AddRoles<IdentityRole>()
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
    
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("Admins", policy =>
        {
            policy.RequireRole("Admin");
        });
    });

    services.AddRazorPages(options =>
    {
        options.Conventions.AuthorizeFolder("/Users");
        options.Conventions.AuthorizeFolder("/Admin", "Admins");

    });
}
```
## Add and apply migrations

We are pretty much set, now we apply the migrations. In the Package Manager Console, run the command

```bash
add-migration initial
```
 The migrations are created and added to the Migration folder

 {{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/migrations.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}
 
 
 Then we can run 

 ```bash
 update-database
 ```
 to test the migrations. 

 If everything is set up correctly, no error will come up and in the *SQL Server Object Explorer* window of visual studio, you can find the database and tables
 
 {{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/sqlserver.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}
 
Note that the `update-database` command creates the database and tables, but is not necessary in our app because `UpdateDatabase` method, which is defined in *Startup.cs* in [Seed data in startup above](#seed-data-in-startup), does the same automatically at startup. Therefore, if this project is deployed to a remote server the database and tables are created automatically with seed data.
 
 When testing, another migration useful command is `drop-database` which deletes the database.

 ## Almost Done
 
 Now from the EF core point of view, we are done. 
 
 ## Create Razor pages

 We need to create some pages to finish the app. Create *crud* folders in Admin and Users folders
 
 {{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/bookcrud_folder.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}
 
 Right-click on *Admin/BookCrud* folder and *Add -> New Scaffolded Item -> Rezor Pages -> Razor Pages Using Entity Frame Work*. Choose Book class and ApplicationDbContext as below
 

{{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/scaffoldBook.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}
 
 
 Hit *create* button and visual studio creates Book crud pages
 
 {{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/bookcrud_folder2.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}
 
Before, you add the scaffolded items for others, change the namespace of new files from `EfCoreRazorCrud` to `EfCoreRazorCrud.Admin.BookCrud`. So namespaces coincide with the folders, and new scaffolded items have their own folder, so it won't be confused with the others. Do the same for *Admin/PublisherCrud* and *Users/BookRead*: create scaffolded items then change their namespace to their folder. Because users are not allowed to crud, delete *Create, Delete, Edit* pages and their references. 
 
 ## Add pages to *_Layout.cshtml*

 To visit these pages, we put their link in `_Layout.cshtml`. Because we need to know if a visitor is a user, admin or anonymous, the below objects are injected in top of the page
 
 ``` c#
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity
@inject SignInManager<Models.AppUser> SignInManager
@inject UserManager<Models.AppUser> UserManager
```

And where the links are we add
```html
<li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Index">Home</a>
</li>
@if (SignInManager.IsSignedIn(User) && User.IsInRole("Admin"))
{
    <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Admin/BookCrud/Index">Crud Books</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Admin/PublisherCrud/Index">Crud Publisher</a>
    </li>
}
@if (SignInManager.IsSignedIn(User))
{
    <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Users/BookRead/Index">See Books</a>
    </li>
}
```
So admin can crud but users only can see the books.

## Run the app

Now we can run the app, and use the Admin email and password mentioned in `SeedData` to login, then crud Books and Publishers. There is just one gotcha

{{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/publisher_id.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}


## Show names instead of id's

We don't want to see publisher id. We want to see the name of the publisher, so in Admin/BookCrud/Index.cshtml and Users/BookRead/Index.cshtml change

```c#
@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Publisher.Id)
```

to

```c#
@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Publisher.Name)
```

There is one more problem in Admin/BookCrud/Create page, still publisher id appears

{{<rawhtml>}}
<img src="/images/EfCoreRazorCrud/bookcreatepage.webp" class="article-image"  />
{{</rawhtml>}}


To fix this, in the code behind of  Admin/BookCrud/Create change

```c#
ViewData["PublisherId"] = new SelectList(_context.Publishers, "Id", "Id");
```

to 

```c#
ViewData["PublisherId"] = new SelectList(_context.Publishers, "Id", "Name");
```

Now you should see the name of publishers to select rather than their Id.
