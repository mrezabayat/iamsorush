## Goal

By default, the identity pages are pre-compiled in .Net core 3.1 and not available to be modified. I want to bring them back so they can be edited.


## Instruction

Follow the below video to add the desired pages. By editing them, they override the compiled versions. Here, I only added *login* page.
