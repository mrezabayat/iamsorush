{{/*
To use jqMath in an html file, use a text editor to copy the above lines to the beginning of
your file, remove any corresponding old tags, and save the file in UTF-8 format.

If you aren’t writing in English, change "en" above to the correct language code, especially if
your language allows a comma as a decimal mark (instead of a period).

If you don’t use Fraktur characters, you can remove the link on line 7, as this may speed up
download times slightly.

You may need to change each "../mathscribe" path above, depending on the directory structure
that you choose.

You can use a different version of jquery (1.0+) if you prefer.  We’ve just provided this one
for your convenience.

If you need to use the \html macro, then uncomment the M.MathPlayer and M.trustHtml line above.
But if you are going to parse untrusted user input using jqMath, even in a blog comment, you
must ensure that M.trustHtml is set back to false first.

The files jscurry-0.4.5.js, jscurry-0.4.5.min.js, and jqmath-0.4.6.js are provided just for your
information.  They are all included, and compressed, in jqmath-etc-0.4.6.min.js.
